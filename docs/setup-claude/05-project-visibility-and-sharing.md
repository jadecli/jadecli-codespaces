# Project Visibility and Sharing in Claude

Control who can see and collaborate on your Claude projects. Here’s how to manage visibility and sharing:

## 1. Setting Project Visibility
- Choose between private, team, or public visibility for each project.
- Private projects are only visible to you.
- Team projects are visible to invited members.
- Public projects can be accessed by anyone with the link (if enabled).

## 2. Sharing Projects
- Share projects with specific people by inviting them via email or username.
- Generate shareable links for broader access (if allowed).

## 3. Managing Permissions
- Assign roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) to control what each member can do.
- Change or revoke access at any time.

## 4. Best Practices
- Use private projects for sensitive work.
- Use team visibility for collaborative efforts.
- Regularly review project members and permissions.
