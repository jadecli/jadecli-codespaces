# Configuration Files

Understanding uv configuration files.

## pyproject.toml

The main project configuration file following PEP 517 and PEP 518:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["uv"]
build-backend = "uv.build"

[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = ["requests"]

[tool.uv]
# uv-specific configuration
```

## uv.toml

A dedicated configuration file for uv-only settings:

```toml
[tool.uv]
python-downloads = "manual"
managed-python = false
```

## uv.lock

Auto-generated lock file containing pinned versions:

```
# This file is autogenerated by uv
# To update, run:
#
#    uv lock
#
version = 1
requires-python = ">=3.11"
```

Do not edit this file manually. It's generated by `uv lock` and ensures reproducible installations.

## Environment configuration

Configure uv through:

- Command-line flags
- Environment variables (`UV_*`)
- Configuration files
